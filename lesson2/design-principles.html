                Fitts's Law describes how long it takes a user to hit a target in a graphical user interface (GUI) or other design, as a function of size and distance. Understanding this law helps us design better buttons, forms, lists, and other interactive elements. 

                In the booking.com website, the principles of Fitt's Law is followed as shown in how the website has a good button and forms. It makes it easy for a user to hit the google forms because of its design.

                Hick’s Law (or the Hick-Hyman Law) is named after a British and an American psychologist team of William Edmund Hick and Ray Hyman. In 1952, this pair set out to examine the relationship between the number of stimuli present and an individual’s reaction time to any given stimulus. As you would expect, the more stimuli to choose from, the longer it takes the user to make a decision on which one to interact with. Users bombarded with choices have to take time to interpret and decide, giving them work they don’t want.

                Viu website has followed the Hick's Law because it has a few options in the screen. It highlights the main video that the website wants user to click.

                Visual hierarchy is the principle of arranging elements to show their order of importance. Designers structure visual characteristics—e.g., menu icons—so users can understand information easily. By laying out elements logically and strategically, designers influence users’ perceptions and guide them to desired actions.

                The Minimalist website is following the Visual hierarchy principle of design. The more important parts have bigger font style as compared to other less important content.
