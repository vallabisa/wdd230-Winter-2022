        <p>Just 12 kilometers from the heart of Singapore and sitting on the slopes of Bukit Timah Hill, this tiny 1.64-square-kilometer park is covered in rain forest and home to over 500 animal species – including the reticulated python, crab-eating macaques, and the rare red-crowned barbet bird. Tropical ferns and dense jungle surround the many hiking trails here, and the reserve also offers rock climbing and abseiling opportunities, as well as mountain-bike trails.</p>

        <p>Singapore's Central Quay is particularly stunning in the evening, as the lights come on over the water. The quay was originally a 19th-century port and mooring space that was eventually abandoned and then revamped into the thriving commercial and entertainment space it is today.</p>

        <p>The nearby modern Jubilee Bridge is the perfect spot to take photos of the Esplanade, the performing arts center located right on the Singapore River. Surrounded by greenery and palm trees, the massive performance venue includes concert halls, areas for experimental theater, and a library.</p>

        <p>This 101-hectare park right on the Marina Reservoir is most famous for its walkway among the canopy of tree-like sculptures covered in exotic ferns and orchids. This is also the perfect place to capture dramatic photos. The lights wrapped around the trees are completely powered by sunlight. The gardens are also home to the world's largest glass greenhouse and the "Cloud Forest," a greenhouse that mimics the weather from tropical mountains and includes a 35-meter-tall indoor waterfall.</p>

        <p>The oldest reservoir in Singapore (dating back to the 1800s) is a popular spot to catch the sunset. TreeTop Walk, a 25-meter-tall suspension bridge, offers visitors a sweeping view of the primary forest that hugs the reservoir.</p>

        <p>Marina Bay Sands, a waterfront resort, is one of the most recognizable and photographed buildings in Singapore. The massive complex includes a hotel, museum, a 74,000-square-meter shopping center, theaters and galleries, and a Skypark with an infinity pool and a rooftop garden overlooking the bay.</p>

        <p>Home to two golf courses, resorts, a Universal Park studio, a casino, and the Adventure Cove Water Park, Sentosa Island also has some of the most beautiful beaches in Singapore. Palawan Beach is particularly famous because of its suspension bridge, which connects the beach to a tiny islet that's considered Asia's closest point to the Equator.</p>

        <p>Man-made Siloso Beach is a prime destination for canoeing, kayaking, and skimboarding – but also the home of many unique attractions, including wind tunnels, artificial barreling waves, ziplines, and Singapore's first bungee jump location. Siloso's stretch of white sands and turquoise lagoons are a popular escape from the city.</p>

        <p>The soft white sands, 250 species of colorful corals, and turquoise waters of the Big Sister and Small Sister islands make for a perfect snorkeling destination. The islands are part of Singapore's First Marine Park and offer two dive options: the six-meter-deep Shallow Dive Trail, where visitors can see giant clams and clownfish, and the 16-meter-deep Deep Dive Trail to swim around sea stars and sea fans.</p>
